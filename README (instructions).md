HotKeys:
Z — "zero" (fill with dead cells / clean the field)
X — fill with live cells (because the "X" is near the "Z" on the keyboard)
R — "random", each cell has a 50% chance will be alive
Q — load "map" (from "map.png")

To load the "map" you must create a map.png file in folder with exe-file
You can draw anything in it, the drawing will shrink to the size of 32 *32 (up to the size of the field)
