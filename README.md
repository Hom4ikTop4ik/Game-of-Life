HotKeys:  
**Z** — "zero" _+ pause_ (clean the field / fill with dead cells)  
**X** — fill with live cells _+ pause_ (because the "X" is near the "Z" on the keyboard)  
**R** — "random" _+ pause_, each cell has a 50% chance will be alive  
**Q** — load "map" _+ pause_ (from "map.png") (why "Q"? because I wanted)  
**SPACE** — pause/start
  
To **load the "map"** you must **create a "map.png"** file in folder with exe-file  
You can draw anything in it, the drawing will shrink to the size of 32*32 (to the size of the field)  


_For developers:_  
graph.py — file I get at school (wrapper over tkinter)
